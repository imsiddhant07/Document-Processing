" One motivation of our work stems from the finding that aspect scores for certain factors like Impact, Originality, Soundness/Correctness which are seemingly central to the merit of the paper, often have very low correlation with the final recommendation made by the reviewers as is made evident in Kang et   (2018)","A Dataset of Peer Reviews (PeerRead): Collection, Insights and NLP Applications",Association for Computational Linguistics

"For Task 2, we observe that the handcrafted feature-based system by Kang et   (2018) performs inferior compared to the baselines","A Dataset of Peer Reviews (PeerRead): Collection, Insights and NLP Applications",Association for Computational Linguistics
 The reason is that the work reported in Kang et   (2018) relies on elementary handcrafted features extracted only from the paper; does not consider the review features whereas we include the review features along with the sentiment information in our deep neural architecture,"A Dataset of Peer Reviews (PeerRead): Collection, Insights and NLP Applications",Association for Computational Linguistics
